  "final": "**Direct Answer**\n```json\n{\"hazard\":\"not specified\"}\n```\n\n**Detailed Operator‑Style Report**\n\n- **Observed anomalies / signatures**\n  - Rapid increase in `customers_out` from 120 at 00:00 to a peak of 9,800 at 01:00, followed by a decline (SNIPPET).\n  - The pattern suggests a large‐scale loss and gradual restoration of service.\n\n- **Why the chosen hazard matches (or does not match)**\n  - The only hazard information in the provided context is a *citywide power outage* reported by the dispatch center [Memory:2].  \n  - No explicit mapping between the telemetry pattern and a specific hazard label (e.g., “Power Outage”, “Electrical Failure”) is given in the context. Therefore, we cannot definitively assign a hazard classification based solely on the snippet.\n\n- **Close alternatives and why they were rejected**\n  - *Fire / hazardous gases*: Mentioned in [Memory:1] but unrelated to the telemetry of customer outages.\n  - *Elevator emergencies*: Also noted in [Memory:2] but not reflected in the data pattern.\n  - Both alternatives lack any direct connection to the `customers_out` metric, so they are rejected.\n\n- **What would confirm or deny the hazard classification**\n  - Additional logs indicating loss of electrical service (e.g., feeder status, transformer alarms).  \n  - Reports from field crews confirming restoration activities matching the timeline of the customer‑out counts.  \n  - Correlation with outage management system entries that tag the event as a power interruption.\n\n*No further hazard cards or classification references are provided in the context.*",
