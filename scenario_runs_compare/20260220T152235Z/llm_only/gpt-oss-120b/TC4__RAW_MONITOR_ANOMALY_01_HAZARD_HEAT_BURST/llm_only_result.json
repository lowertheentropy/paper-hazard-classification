The observed temperature spike, dewpoint plunge, RH collapse, and wind gusts fit this definition【Memory:1】【Snippet】.  \n- **Temporal pattern:** The event occurs at night, lasts only a few minutes, then cooling resumes—exactly the reported “brief” nature of dry microburst outflows【Memory:1】.  \n\n### Close alternatives & why they were rejected  \n\n| Alternative | Reason for rejection |\n|-------------|----------------------|\n| **Wet Microburst / Downburst** | Would show *cooling* and higher moisture (dewpoint ≈ ambient) as rain‑cooled air descends; the data show strong warming and drying【Snippet】. |\n| **Thunderstorm Outflow (Gust Front)** | Typically accompanied by a temperature *drop* and possible precipitation; no precip recorded (precip_in = 0.00) and temperatures rise sharply【Snippet】. |\n| **Heat Wave** | Occurs over hours to days, not a 15‑minute burst; also lacks the abrupt wind gusts observed【Snippet】. |\n\n### What would confirm or deny the classification  \n- **Vertical wind profile (radar/lidar):** Detection of a descending high‑density air column at the time of the event would confirm a microburst.  \n- **Surface pressure spikes:** Microbursts often produce a brief pressure rise; high‑resolution barometer data could verify this.  \n- **Infrared satellite imagery:** A “heat burst” signature (hot spot) coincident with the timing would support the dry microburst hypothesis.  \n- **Absence of precipitation radar returns** during the event would further rule out wet downbursts or gust fronts.\n\n### Operator Recommendations  \n1. **Log the event as a Dry Microburst** in incident tracking systems.  \n2. **Alert nearby aviation and fire‑control units** about potential sudden wind shear and rapid temperature changes.  \n3. **Collect additional sensor data** (high‑frequency pressure, vertical wind) for post‑event analysis to refine detection algorithms.  \n\n### Further Information Links (from hazard reference cards)  \n- *Dry Microburst* – NOAA Storm Prediction Center (SPC) microburst guidance.  \n- *Heat Burst Phenomenon* – National Weather Service glossary.  \n\n*(All citations refer to the provided context: dispatch call summary【Memory:1】 and the telemetry snippet【Snippet】.)*",
