## Question
Hazard classification (Top-1). Use ONLY CONTEXT as evidence.

Output requirements:
- Direct Answer: ONE-LINE JSON as specified by the simple-rag prompt.
- After the JSON, write a detailed, operator-style report:
  * Observed anomalies / signatures (bullet list)
  * Why the chosen hazard matches (cite specific retrieved fields: sampleData, keywords/altLabel, triggers/causes, impacts)
  * 1–3 close alternatives and why they were rejected (with citations)
  * What would confirm/deny (additional measurements / logs).



SNIPPET:
Shortly after a nearby earthquake, multiple shore observers report rhythmic water level oscillations in a lake/harbor basin. No tsunami warning exists and there is no ocean exposure, but small craft lines snap due to repeated sloshing and resonance-like waves.

ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
- After the Direct Answer JSON, provide a Detailed Report with: hazard overview; why this match (with citations); operator recommendations; further information links (from cited hazard card sources).

## Final Answer
**Direct Answer**  
```json
{"hazard":"Seiche"}
```

## Detailed Operator‑Style Report  

### Observed anomalies / signatures  
- Rhythmic oscillation of lake water level after a noticeable earthquake.  
- Repeated striking of boats against the pier/dock and snapping of mooring lines.  
- No tsunami warning; the body of water is inland with no ocean exposure.  \[Memory:1\]

### Why “Seiche” matches the hazard (citations)  
| Evidence | How it supports Seiche classification |
|----------|----------------------------------------|
| **Sample data / description** – rhythmic lake‑level oscillations following seismic shaking. | A classic trigger for a seiche is an earthquake that induces standing waves in enclosed water bodies. \[Memory:1\] |
| **Keywords/altLabel** – not specified in the provided context, but “oscillating water level” and “resonance‑like waves” are typical descriptors of seiches. | (implicit) |
| **Triggers / causes** – earthquake as the initiating event; no tsunami or oceanic source. | Seiches are commonly generated by seismic activity in lakes and harbors. \[Memory:1\] |
| **Impacts** – vessels striking structures, lines snapping due to repeated sloshing. | These impacts align with documented seiche effects on shoreline infrastructure. \[Memory:1\] |

### Close alternatives considered (and why rejected)  

| Alternative | Reason for rejection (citation) |
|-------------|---------------------------------|
| **Tsunami** | No tsunami warning; the water body is inland and not ocean‑connected. \[Memory:1\] |
| **Storm surge / wind‑driven wave set‑up** | No mention of severe weather or sustained winds; the trigger was an earthquake, not atmospheric forcing. \[not specified\] |
| **Landslide‑generated impulse wave** | No evidence of a landslide into the lake; only seismic shaking is reported. \[not specified\] |

### What would confirm or deny the classification  
- **High‑frequency water‑level loggers** showing standing‑wave periods consistent with basin resonance.  \[not specified\]  
- **Seismometer data** correlating ground motion timing with onset of oscillations.  \[not specified\]  
- **Bathymetric and shoreline geometry analysis** confirming natural resonant modes matching observed period.  \[not specified\]  
- Absence of these signatures, or detection of a wave front propagating from an external source, would argue against a seiche.

### Operator Recommendations (hazard overview)  
- Treat the event as a **seismic‑induced seiche** and issue alerts to vessels and dock personnel about potential rapid water‑level swings.  \[Memory:1\]  
- Deploy temporary mooring reinforcement and restrict docking until oscillations subside.  \[not specified\]  

### Further Information Links (from cited hazard card sources)  
- Not specified.

## Retrieved Context (Memory-only)
### Memory
```
[Memory:1 Situation note] Harbor master: After a noticeable earthquake, the lake’s water level is oscillating rhythmically. Boats are repeatedly striking the pier/dock, lines are snapping. No tsunami—this is an inland body of water.
