Use ONLY CONTEXT as evidence.\n\n    Output requirements:\n    - Direct Answer: ONE-LINE JSON as specified by the simple-rag prompt.\n    - After the JSON, write a detailed, operator-style report:\n      * Observed anomalies / signatures (bullet list)\n      * Why the chosen hazard matches (cite specific retrieved fields: sampleData, keywords/altLabel, triggers/causes, impacts)\n      * 1–3 close alternatives and why they were rejected (with citations)\n      * What would confirm/deny (additional measurements / logs).\n\n    No natural-language hints are provided. Treat the snippet as raw telemetry/event-table; infer the most plausible hazard label from the pattern.\n\n    SNIPPET:\n    year,mo,dy,latitude,longitude,cause,max_height_m,deaths,country\n2004,12,26,3.316,95.854,Earthquake,51,227898,Indonesia\n2011,3,11,38.297,142.372,Earthquake,40.5,19900,Japan\n\nADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS:\n- After the Direct Answer JSON, provide a Detailed Report with: hazard overview; why this match (with citations); operator recommendations; further information links (from cited hazard card sources).",
