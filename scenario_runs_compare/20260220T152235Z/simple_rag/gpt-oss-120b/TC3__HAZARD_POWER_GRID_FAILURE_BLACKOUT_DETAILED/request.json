  "question": "Hazard classification (Top-1). Use ONLY CONTEXT as evidence.\n\nOutput requirements:\n- Direct Answer: ONE-LINE JSON as specified by the simple-rag prompt.\n- After the JSON, write a detailed, operator-style report:\n  * Observed anomalies / signatures (bullet list)\n  * Why the chosen hazard matches (cite specific retrieved fields: sampleData, keywords/altLabel, triggers/causes, impacts)\n  * 1–3 close alternatives and why they were rejected (with citations)\n  * What would confirm/deny (additional measurements / logs).\n\n\n\nSNIPPET:\nCitywide outage: mobile networks degrade, traffic lights fail, and dispatch logs show rapidly rising outage counts followed by partial recovery. Critical infrastructure shifts to backup power; multiple incidents are triggered by the loss of electricity across districts.\n\nADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS:\n- After the Direct Answer JSON, provide a Detailed Report with: hazard overview; why this match (with citations); operator recommendations; further information links (from cited hazard card sources).",
