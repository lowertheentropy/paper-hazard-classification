Witnesses describe a sudden \"hot blast\" with strong downslope wind, but no wildfire is reported.\n\nADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS:\n- After the Direct Answer JSON, provide a Detailed Report with: hazard overview; why this match (with citations); operator recommendations; further information links (from cited hazard card sources).\n"
