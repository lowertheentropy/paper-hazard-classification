  "question": "Hazard classification (Top-1). Use ONLY CONTEXT as evidence.\n\nOutput requirements:\n- Direct Answer: ONE-LINE JSON as specified by the simple-rag prompt.\n- After the JSON, write a detailed, operator-style report:\n  * Observed anomalies / signatures (bullet list)\n  * Why the chosen hazard matches (cite specific retrieved fields: sampleData, keywords/altLabel, triggers/causes, impacts)\n  * 1–3 close alternatives and why they were rejected (with citations)\n  * What would confirm/deny (additional measurements / logs).\n\n\n\nSNIPPET:\nAt 00:05 local time the temperature jumps rapidly into the mid-80s F while humidity drops and gusty winds appear; within minutes values partially recover. Witnesses describe a sudden \"hot blast\" with strong downslope wind, but no wildfire is reported.\n\nADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS:\n- After the Direct Answer JSON, provide a Detailed Report with: hazard overview; why this match (with citations); operator recommendations; further information links (from cited hazard card sources).",
