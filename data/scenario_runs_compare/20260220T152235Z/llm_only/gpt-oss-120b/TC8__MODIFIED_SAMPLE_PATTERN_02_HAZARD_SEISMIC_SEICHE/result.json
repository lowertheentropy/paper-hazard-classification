Consequently, there is no evidence in the provided material to map these readings to a specific hazard type.\n\n- **Close alternatives and why they were rejected**\n  - *Electrical fault* – would require fields such as voltage/current labels, overload triggers, or fault codes; none are present.\n  - *Mechanical vibration/imbalance* – typically accompanied by frequency spectra, RPM data, or vibration‑specific keywords; absent here.\n  - *Sensor noise or calibration error* – might be inferred from erratic sign changes, but without sensor specifications or error thresholds, this remains speculative.\n\n- **What would confirm/deny the hazard classification**\n  - Additional telemetry context: units (e.g., volts, degrees Celsius), sensor identifiers, and normal operating ranges.\n  - Event logs or alarm records indicating trigger conditions (over‑temperature, over‑current, pressure spikes, etc.).\n  - Correlated data streams (e.g., power supply status, mechanical speed) to establish causal relationships.\n\n- **Operator recommendations**\n  - Request full hazard taxonomy or reference cards that define possible classifications and their associated data fields.\n  - Obtain accompanying metadata for the telemetry series (sensor type, measurement units, normal limits).\n  - Collect concurrent system logs or alarm histories to provide the necessary evidence for a definitive hazard determination.",
