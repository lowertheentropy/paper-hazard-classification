  "final": "**Direct Answer:**  \n```json\n{\"hazard\":\"Power Outage\"}\n```\n\n**Detailed Report**\n\n**Observed anomalies / signatures**\n- Heavy smoke from a cable duct/cable route with ongoing firefighting and hazardous gases present【Memory:1】.  \n- Citywide power outage reported by the dispatch center【Memory:2】.  \n- Mobile network instability, traffic lights out of service, multiple elevator emergencies【Memory:2】.  \n- Grid operator notes rising outage numbers with partial restoration in some streets/blocks【Memory:2】.  \n- Snippet describes “Citywide outage: mobile networks degrade, traffic lights fail… loss of electricity across districts”【Snippet】.\n\n**Why the chosen hazard matches**\nThe dominant and system‑wide disturbance described is a **power outage**, which is explicitly mentioned in both the dispatch center log (“Citywide power outage”) and the supporting snippet that details infrastructure failures (mobile network, traffic signals, elevators) caused by loss of electricity. These elements collectively define the primary hazard affecting the city’s operations.\n\n**Close alternatives and why they were rejected**\n| Alternative | Reason for rejection |\n|-------------|----------------------|\n| **Fire** – heavy smoke and firefighting in a cable duct【Memory:1】 | While fire is present locally, the broader impact described (citywide infrastructure failure) points to power loss as the overarching hazard. |\n| **Hazardous Gas Leak** – dangerous gases persisting at the fire site【Memory:1】 | The gas threat is confined to the fire location; it does not explain the citywide outages and network failures. |\n| **Elevator Emergency** – multiple elevator incidents reported【Memory:2】 | These are secondary effects caused by loss of power rather than a primary hazard themselves. |\n\n**What would confirm or deny this classification**\n- **Confirming measurements:** Real‑time grid status logs showing voltage drops/outages; SCADA reports from the utility confirming loss of supply; backup generator activation records across critical facilities.  \n- **Denying measurements:** Absence of grid outage data combined with confirmed fire containment and no power interruption in substations would shift classification toward a localized fire or gas incident.\n\n**Operator‑style recommendations**\n1. Prioritize restoration of primary power feeds to critical infrastructure (hospitals, emergency services).  \n2. Deploy mobile generators to support traffic control systems and communication hubs.  \n3. Continue monitoring the fire site for hazardous gas concentrations; keep evacuation zones in place until gases are cleared.  \n4. Coordinate with utility crews to verify which districts have achieved partial restoration and where additional resources are needed.\n\n**Further information links**\n- Not specified.",

    "question": "Hazard classification (Top-1). Use ONLY CONTEXT as evidence.\n\nOutput requirements:\n- Direct Answer: ONE-LINE JSON as specified by the simple-rag prompt.\n- After the JSON, write a detailed, operator-style report:\n  * Observed anomalies / signatures (bullet list)\n  * Why the chosen hazard matches (cite specific retrieved fields: sampleData, keywords/altLabel, triggers/causes, impacts)\n  * 1–3 close alternatives and why they were rejected (with citations)\n  * What would confirm/deny (additional measurements / logs).\n\n\n\nSNIPPET:\nCitywide outage: mobile networks degrade, traffic lights fail, and dispatch logs show rapidly rising outage counts followed by partial recovery. Critical infrastructure shifts to backup power; multiple incidents are triggered by the loss of electricity across districts.\n\nADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS:\n- After the Direct Answer JSON, provide a Detailed Report with: hazard overview; why this match (with citations); operator recommendations; further information links (from cited hazard card sources)."
